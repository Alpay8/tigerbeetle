# TigerBeetle Changelog

## 2023-10-30

### Safety And Performance

- [#1251](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1251)

  Prove a tighter upper bound for the size of manifest log. With this new bound, manifest log is
  guaranteed to fit in allocated memory and is smaller. Additionally, manifest log compaction is
  paced depending on the current length of the log, balancing throughput and time-to-recovery.

- [#1198](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1198)

  Recommend using [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec) for event IDs. ULIDs are approximately sorted,
  which significantly improves common-case performance.

### Internals

- [#1218](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1218)

  Rewrite Node.js client implementation to use the common C client underneath. While clients for
  other languages already use the underlying C library, the Node.js client duplicated some code for
  historical reasons, but now we can leave that duplication in the past. [This Is A

### Safety And Performance

- [#1240](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1240)

  Increase block size to reduce latencies due to compaction work. Today, we use a simplistic
  schedule for compaction, which causes latency spikes at the end of the bar. While the future
  solution will implement a smarter compaction pacing to distribute the work more evenly, we can
  get a quick win by tweaking the block and the bar size, which naturally evens out latency spikes.

- [#1246](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1246)

  The new release process changed the names of the published artifacts (the version is no longer
  included in the name). This broke our quick start scripts, which we have fixed. Note that we are
  in the process of rolling out the new release process, so some unexpected breakage is expected.

- [#1239](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1239),
  [#1243](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1243)

  Speed up secondary index maintenance by statically distinguishing between insertions and
  updates. [Faster than the speed of night!](https://open.spotify.com/track/30oZqbcUROFLSru3WcN3bx)

### Features

- [#1245](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1245)

  Include Docker images in the release.

### Internals

- [#1234](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1234)

  Simplify superblock layout by using a linked list of blocks for manifest log, so that the
  superblock needs to store only two block references.

  P.S. Note the PR number!

## 2023-10-23

This is the start of the changelog. A lot happened before this point and is lost in the mist of git
history, but any notable change from this point on shall be captured by this document.

### Safety And Performance

- [#1225](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1225)

  Remove bloom filters. TigerBeetle implements more targeted optimizations for
  both positive and negative lookups, making bloom filters a net loss.

### Features

- [#1228](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1228)

  Increase alignment of data blocks to 128KiB (from 512 bytes). Larger alignment gives operators
  better control over physical layout of data on disk.

### Internals

- [#1201](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1201),
  [#1232](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1232)

  Overhaul of CI and release infrastructure. CI and releases are now driven by Zig code. The main
  branch is gated on integration tests for all clients.

  This is done in preparation for the first TigerBeetle release.
